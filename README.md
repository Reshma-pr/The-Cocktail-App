# The-Cocktail-App
BackGround Story: As a beginner in flutter after learning basic apps  like the weather app, I tried exploring flutter by using free API's. The free cockttail API is used to generate a list of cocktails/mocktails and get the ingredients and recipe of it. This project does not focus on the UI of the App, but mainly on decoding JSON data, Future Builders etc. (The code is not refactored , I might refactor it later :))


The App consists of a bottom Navigation bar with options Cocktails and Mocktails:

On pressed navigates to the particular Drink's page displaying ingredients and the Recipe.
